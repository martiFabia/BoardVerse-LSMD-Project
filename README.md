# BoardVerse-LSMD-Project

**BoardVerse** is an application for true board game fans that allows users
to discover, explore and share this passion. Thanks to a wide catalogue
of games, users can search for new gaming experiences, read detailed
reviews and ratings from other players, or share their opinions to help
the community. <br>
You can create a custom list of your favorite games, follow the latest
trends, organize tournaments and connect with other fans with similar
tastes. The platform also offers spaces for group discussions, where
players can exchange strategies, tips and ideas. <br>
This rich catalog is maintained by administrators, who not only add,
update or remove games, but also supervise all user activities. For example,
they can moderate inappropriate reviews or comments, ensuring
that the app remains a welcoming environment and in line with the
friendly spirit of the community. <br>
The application uses a combination of technologies such as **MongoDB** for
flexible management of documents and **Neo4j** to represent relationships
between users, games and tournaments in an advanced way.
